# CS-320
To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I follow coding best practices and run tests as I work to reduce complications while merging code together.

I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by breaking down the requirements given by the customer into what it must do and what it must not do.

I approach designing software carefully since having a good design for the software will save time and reduce errors.
